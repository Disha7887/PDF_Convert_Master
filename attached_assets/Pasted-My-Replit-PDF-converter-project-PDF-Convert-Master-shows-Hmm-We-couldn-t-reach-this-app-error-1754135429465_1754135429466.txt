My Replit PDF converter project (PDF_Convert_Master) shows "Hmm... We couldn't reach this app" error and I can't access my existing client dashboard. I need to restore my working authentication system and dashboard without losing any existing components.

CURRENT SITUATION:
- Replit project: PDF_Convert_Master exists with all files ✅
- API_DOCUMENTATION.md and deployment files present ✅
- Database schema and backend code implemented ✅
- BUT: Application not starting/serving properly ❌
- Dashboard and authentication pages inaccessible ❌

IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED:

1. APPLICATION STARTUP ISSUES:
- Check if server.js/main application file is properly configured
- Verify package.json scripts and dependencies
- Ensure proper port configuration for Replit environment
- Fix any startup errors preventing the app from running

2. RESTORE EXISTING COMPONENTS:
- DO NOT recreate or replace existing dashboard components
- DO NOT generate new authentication pages
- Preserve all existing React/Frontend components exactly as designed
- Keep current UI/UX design and styling intact

3. SERVER CONFIGURATION:
- Verify Node.js server starts correctly on Replit's environment
- Check environment variables and database connections
- Ensure proper routing for existing frontend components
- Fix any CORS or middleware configuration issues

4. DATABASE CONNECTION:
- Verify PostgreSQL connection is working
- Check if database tables exist and are properly configured
- Ensure authentication queries work with existing user data
- Test JWT token generation and validation

5. DEBUGGING STEPS:
- Check Replit Console for startup errors
- Verify all required dependencies are installed
- Test basic server health endpoint
- Check if frontend build/compilation is working

6. PRESERVE EXISTING ARCHITECTURE:
- Keep current file structure and components
- Maintain existing authentication flow
- Preserve dashboard functionality and API key management
- Keep all existing conversion tools and endpoints

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Application starts successfully on Replit
- Existing client dashboard becomes accessible
- Users can log in and access their dashboard
- All current functionality preserved without modifications
- No loss of existing UI design or components

Please restore the application to working state while preserving all existing dashboard and authentication components exactly as they were designed.
