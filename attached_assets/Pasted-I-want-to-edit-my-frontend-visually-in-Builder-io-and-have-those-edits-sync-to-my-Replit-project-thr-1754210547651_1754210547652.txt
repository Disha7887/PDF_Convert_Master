I want to edit my frontend visually in Builder.io and have those edits sync to my Replit project through GitHub. Please help me:

1. Connect my Builder.io account to my GitHub repository:
   - Go to Builder.io → Account Settings → GitHub Integration
   - Connect my GitHub account
   - Select the correct repo (pdf-convert-frontend)
   - Choose the main branch
   - Set the working folder path (like /src or /src/pages)

2. Make sure Builder.io can commit changes to that repo after editing.

3. In Replit:
   - Pull the latest GitHub changes using `git pull origin main`
   - Or configure auto-deployment from GitHub if supported

4. Ensure my existing design and layout are not overwritten — only sync the content/components I update in Builder.io.

5. Verify that all Builder.io edits reflect correctly when I run my frontend in Replit.

Set up the full flow: **Builder.io → GitHub → Replit**

I want to separate my backend and frontend and with new front end connect with github new repository and builder io will change this frontend and after edit done I only pull the frontend repository

Here’s your Replit AI prompt to separate your backend and frontend, connect the frontend to a new GitHub repo, and make Builder.io handle frontend edits that you can pull manually later:

I want to separate my backend and frontend into two clean projects.

1. Move my current frontend code into a new folder/project called `frontend/` and initialize it as a standalone Git project.

2. Push the frontend to a **new GitHub repository**, e.g., `https://github.com/myusername/pdf-frontend`.

3. Connect this new frontend repo to Builder.io:
   - In Builder.io → Account Settings → GitHub Integration
   - Select the new GitHub repository (`pdf-frontend`)
   - Link the `main` branch
   - Set the folder path for components/pages (e.g., `/src/pages`)

4. After making edits in Builder.io, I will **pull** the latest changes into Replit using:
cd frontend
git pull origin main

5. My backend will remain as a separate project (in another Replit workspace or folder), and continue working without changes.

6. I do not want to modify my frontend design manually — all edits will be visual through Builder.io and pulled in via GitHub only.

Set up this full workflow:  
**Backend (separate)**  
**Frontend → GitHub → Builder.io → GitHub → Replit (manual pull)**
