My PDF conversion tool in Replit is still generating dummy/placeholder files instead of performing real conversions. All downloaded files contain the same template message instead of actual converted content.

CURRENT ISSUE ANALYSIS:
- Backend shows "Job completed successfully" with fast processing times (5 seconds)
- Download works perfectly and files download quickly
- BUT: All files contain dummy content with template message:
  "CONVERSION COMPLETED - This demo file represents a successfully converted file. In a production environment, this would be the actual converted file."
- Users receive fake conversion results instead of real file transformations

CRITICAL BACKEND FIXES NEEDED:

1. REPLACE DUMMY FILE GENERATION:
Current broken process:
- File uploads correctly ✅
- Processing time optimized ✅  
- Download works ✅
- BUT: Creates template/demo files instead of real conversions ❌

Required real conversion process:
- File uploads correctly ✅
- ACTUAL file processing with conversion libraries ✅
- Real converted content generated ✅
- Download real converted files ✅

2. IMPLEMENT REAL CONVERSION LIBRARIES:
- PDF to Word: Use pdf-poppler + mammoth for actual PDF→DOCX conversion
- PDF to Images: Use pdf2pic for real PDF→JPG extraction
- Image to PDF: Use pdf-lib to embed actual images
- Compress PDF: Use real compression algorithms on actual PDF content
- Word to PDF: Use actual DOCX parsing and PDF generation

3. BACKEND CODE FIXES NEEDED:
In server/routes.ts, replace dummy file generation with:
- Real file processing using appropriate libraries
- Actual content extraction and transformation
- Proper error handling for conversion failures
- Validation that conversion actually occurred

4. SPECIFIC CONVERSION IMPLEMENTATIONS:
- PDF to Word: Extract actual text/images from PDF, create real DOCX
- Images to PDF: Embed uploaded images into new PDF document
- Compress PDF: Apply real compression to reduce file size
- Rotate PDF: Actually rotate PDF pages, not create demo file
- Format conversions: Perform real file format transformations

5. TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
- Upload a PDF with text content
- Convert to Word format  
- Verify downloaded DOCX contains actual text from original PDF (not template message)
- Test with different file types and sizes
- Ensure each tool produces real transformed content

6. QUALITY ASSURANCE:
- Converted files should open in appropriate applications (Word, PDF readers, etc.)
- Content should match original file but in new format
- File sizes should be realistic (not identical template files)
- Multiple conversions should produce different results based on input

IMMEDIATE PRIORITY:
Replace all dummy/template file generation with real conversion processing using proper libraries. Users need actual converted files, not demo content with placeholder messages.

Please implement real file conversion logic that processes actual file content and produces genuine converted documents.
