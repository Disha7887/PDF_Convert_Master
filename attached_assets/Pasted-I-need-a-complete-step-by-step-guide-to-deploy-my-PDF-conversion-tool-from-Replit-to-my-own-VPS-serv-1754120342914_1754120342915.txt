I need a complete step-by-step guide to deploy my PDF conversion tool from Replit to my own VPS server. I'm new to coding, so please provide detailed instructions with proper commands and configurations.

VPS DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS:
- Deploy from my current Replit project to VPS
- Enable multiple file uploads that process simultaneously 
- Maintain all 20 conversion tools functionality
- Set up proper domain and SSL configuration
- Ensure scalable file processing capabilities

STEP-BY-STEP DEPLOYMENT GUIDE NEEDED:

STEP 1: VPS SERVER SETUP
- Choose appropriate VPS specifications (RAM, CPU, storage)
- Operating system installation (Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 recommended)
- Initial server security configuration
- User account setup and SSH key configuration

STEP 2: SERVER ENVIRONMENT SETUP
- Install Node.js (latest LTS version)
- Install PM2 for process management
- Install Nginx as reverse proxy
- Install SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt)
- Configure firewall settings

STEP 3: DATABASE & STORAGE SETUP
- Set up proper file storage directories
- Configure temporary file cleanup
- Set up database if needed for job tracking
- Configure backup systems

STEP 4: APPLICATION DEPLOYMENT
- Clone/download code from Replit to VPS
- Install all dependencies (npm install)
- Configure environment variables
- Set up proper file permissions
- Configure PM2 process file

STEP 5: MULTIPLE FILE UPLOAD ENHANCEMENT
- Implement queue system for simultaneous conversions
- Set up file chunking for large uploads
- Configure concurrent processing limits
- Add batch conversion API endpoints
- Implement progress tracking for multiple files

STEP 6: NGINX CONFIGURATION
- Configure reverse proxy settings
- Set up SSL termination
- Configure file upload size limits
- Set up static file serving
- Configure load balancing if needed

STEP 7: DOMAIN & SSL SETUP
- Point domain to VPS IP address
- Configure DNS records
- Install and configure SSL certificate
- Set up automatic SSL renewal

STEP 8: MONITORING & MAINTENANCE
- Set up log monitoring
- Configure automated backups
- Set up health checks
- Configure email alerts for errors

SPECIFIC CODE REQUIREMENTS:
- Complete nginx.conf configuration
- PM2 ecosystem.config.js file
- Environment variables setup
- Multiple file upload implementation
- Concurrent processing queue system
- Error handling and logging setup

MULTIPLE FILE PROCESSING FEATURES:
- Drag and drop multiple files simultaneously
- Show individual progress for each file
- Process files concurrently (not sequentially)
- Download individual files or bulk download
- Queue management for large batches

Please provide complete commands, configuration files, and code implementations for each step. Include troubleshooting tips and common issues to watch for during deployment.
