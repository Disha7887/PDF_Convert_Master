My Replit PDF converter shows "Login Successful" message but it's not redirecting to my existing client dashboard portal. The login works but users remain stuck on the login page instead of accessing their dashboard.

CURRENT ISSUE:
- Login authentication works (shows "Login Successful" message) ✅
- JWT token is generated and stored ✅
- BUT: User stays on login page instead of redirecting to dashboard ❌
- Existing dashboard portal exists but isn't being accessed ❌

SPECIFIC FIXES NEEDED:

1. FIX LOGIN REDIRECT LOGIC:
- After successful login, automatically redirect to /dashboard
- Clear login form and remove "Login Successful" popup
- Ensure proper React Router navigation after authentication
- Update authentication state to trigger dashboard access

2. PRESERVE EXISTING DASHBOARD:
- DO NOT replace or modify my existing client dashboard UI
- Keep all current dashboard components and design intact
- Ensure existing dashboard routes and functionality work
- Maintain current dashboard layout and features

3. AUTHENTICATION FLOW FIX:
Current broken flow: Login ✅ → Success message ✅ → Stays on login page ❌
Required working flow: Login ✅ → Success message ✅ → Redirect to dashboard ✅

4. ROUTING UPDATES NEEDED:
- Fix React Router to properly handle authenticated user redirects
- Update App.tsx routing logic to show dashboard for logged-in users
- Ensure protected routes work correctly with JWT authentication
- Fix any route conflicts preventing dashboard access

5. STATE MANAGEMENT FIX:
- Update authentication context/state after successful login
- Ensure isAuthenticated state triggers dashboard view
- Fix any state persistence issues preventing dashboard access
- Clear any conflicting states that block dashboard rendering

6. DEBUGGING STEPS:
- Check if JWT token is properly stored in localStorage/cookies
- Verify authentication state updates after login
- Test dashboard route accessibility for authenticated users
- Ensure no console errors preventing dashboard rendering

EXPECTED RESULT:
- User logs in successfully
- Gets redirected immediately to existing dashboard
- Can access all current dashboard features
- No modification to existing dashboard design or functionality

Please fix the login redirect so users can access their existing dashboard portal after successful authentication.
