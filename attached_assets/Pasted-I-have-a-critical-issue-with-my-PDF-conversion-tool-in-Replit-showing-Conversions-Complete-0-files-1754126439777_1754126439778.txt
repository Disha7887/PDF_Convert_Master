I have a critical issue with my PDF conversion tool in Replit showing "Conversions Complete! 0 files converted successfully. Download buttons are now available." This contradicts the backend logs which show successful file processing.

CURRENT ISSUE ANALYSIS:
- Backend logs confirm: "Real-time file processing ✅", "Real downloadable files ✅", "Fully dynamic API flow ✅"
- Frontend shows: "0 files converted successfully" but claims download buttons are available
- This indicates a disconnect between backend success and frontend state management
- Users see contradictory messages and cannot access their converted files

CRITICAL FIXES NEEDED:

1. FRONTEND-BACKEND STATE SYNC:
- Fix job status polling in ConversionWorkflow.tsx
- Ensure frontend correctly reads "completed" status from backend
- Update file conversion counter to reflect actual successful conversions
- Fix React state management for completed files array

2. DOWNLOAD BUTTON VISIBILITY:
- If "Download buttons are now available" but showing "0 files converted", there's a UI logic error
- Fix the condition that shows download buttons vs. conversion count
- Ensure download buttons appear for each successfully converted file
- Test download functionality with actual converted files

3. JOB POLLING AND STATUS UPDATES:
- Verify job polling correctly updates from "processing" → "completed"
- Fix conversion counter to increment when jobs finish successfully
- Ensure real-time status updates reflect in the UI immediately
- Check if polling stops prematurely before completion

4. API RESPONSE HANDLING:
- Backend shows successful job completion but frontend shows 0 conversions
- Fix API response parsing in frontend
- Ensure proper error handling doesn't mark successful jobs as failed
- Verify job completion logic matches backend implementation

5. TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
Current broken flow:
- File uploads ✅
- Backend processes successfully ✅
- Job completes ✅
- Frontend shows "0 files converted" ❌
- Download buttons claim to be available ❌

Required working flow:
- File uploads ✅
- Backend processes successfully ✅
- Job completes ✅
- Frontend shows "1 file converted successfully" ✅
- Download buttons actually appear and work ✅

6. IMMEDIATE DEBUGGING STEPS:
- Check React Developer Tools for state updates during conversion
- Verify API polling responses in Network tab
- Test download button functionality if they're truly "available"
- Check console for any JavaScript errors during conversion process

PRIORITY ORDER:
1. Fix conversion counter to show actual successful conversions (CRITICAL)
2. Ensure download buttons appear for completed files
3. Test actual file downloads work properly
4. Fix any UI/UX inconsistencies in success messaging

Please fix the frontend state management so users see accurate conversion counts and can successfully download their converted files when the backend processing completes successfully.
