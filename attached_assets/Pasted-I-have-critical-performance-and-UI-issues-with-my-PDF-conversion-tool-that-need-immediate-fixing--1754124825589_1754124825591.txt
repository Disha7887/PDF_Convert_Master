I have critical performance and UI issues with my PDF conversion tool that need immediate fixing:

CURRENT CRITICAL ISSUES:
- File conversion is extremely slow (showing 38% progress after significant time)
- Files are stuck in "Currently converting" state indefinitely
- No download button appears after conversion completion
- Progress bar shows "1 Remaining" but never completes
- Backend API returns success JSON but frontend doesn't update properly

IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED:

1. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
- Conversion process is taking too long (should be 10-30 seconds max)
- Need to optimize backend processing speed
- Check if files are being processed sequentially instead of efficiently
- Investigate memory usage and processing bottlenecks
- Add timeout handling for stuck conversions

2. PROGRESS BAR ISSUES:
- Progress gets stuck at 38% and doesn't complete
- "1 Remaining" counter never reaches 0
- Need real-time progress updates from backend
- Fix progress calculation logic in frontend

3. MISSING DOWNLOAD BUTTON:
- Download button never appears even after successful conversion
- Backend shows: {"success":true,"message":"File download started","filename":"ready-1485947_converted.pdf"}
- Frontend state management not updating to show completed files
- ConversionWorkflow.tsx not rendering download UI properly

4. BACKEND API ISSUES:
- /api/download/:fileId returning JSON instead of actual file stream
- Need to implement proper file serving with res.download()
- Fix Content-Type headers for file downloads
- Ensure files are actually saved and accessible

SPECIFIC DEBUGGING STEPS:

FRONTEND FIXES:
- Fix React state updates causing UI to not refresh
- Ensure completion logic updates file status from "processing" to "completed"
- Make download button visible when files finish processing
- Fix progress bar to reach 100% and show completion

BACKEND FIXES:
- Optimize conversion libraries for faster processing
- Implement proper file streaming for downloads
- Add better error handling and timeout management
- Fix file cleanup and storage issues

TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
1. File conversion completes in under 60 seconds
2. Progress bar reaches 100% completion
3. Download button appears immediately after completion
4. Clicking download actually downloads the file (not JSON)
5. Multiple files process efficiently

PRIORITY ORDER:
1. Fix slow conversion speed (critical performance issue)
2. Make download button appear after completion
3. Fix download endpoint to serve actual files
4. Optimize overall user experience

Please provide immediate fixes for these critical issues so users can successfully convert and download their files quickly.
