My PDF conversion tool in Replit is taking too long to convert single files (currently showing 48% progress after significant time). Need to optimize conversion speed for better user experience.

CURRENT PERFORMANCE ISSUES:
- Single file conversion taking several minutes instead of 30-60 seconds
- Progress bar moving very slowly (stuck at 48% for extended time)
- Backend processing is inefficient and causing delays
- Users abandoning conversions due to slow speeds

IMMEDIATE OPTIMIZATION NEEDED:

1. BACKEND PROCESSING OPTIMIZATION:
- Optimize conversion libraries (pdf-lib, sharp, mammoth) for faster processing
- Remove unnecessary file operations and redundant processing steps
- Implement efficient memory management during conversion
- Add compression algorithms that don't sacrifice too much quality for speed

2. FILE PROCESSING PIPELINE:
- Stream processing instead of loading entire files into memory
- Parallel processing for multi-step conversions
- Optimize temporary file handling (reduce I/O operations)
- Cache frequently used conversion settings

3. PROGRESS TRACKING IMPROVEMENTS:
- Implement more accurate progress reporting from backend
- Break conversion into smaller chunks with progress updates
- Add real-time feedback every 10-20% completion
- Fix progress calculation to reflect actual processing speed

4. PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS:
Target conversion times:
- Small files (< 1MB): 5-15 seconds
- Medium files (1-5MB): 15-45 seconds  
- Large files (5-10MB): 45-90 seconds
- Very large files (10MB+): 90-120 seconds max

5. BACKEND OPTIMIZATIONS:
- Use worker threads for CPU-intensive conversions
- Implement file chunking for large documents
- Optimize image processing with lower quality settings for speed
- Add conversion timeout limits (max 2-3 minutes)

6. INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
- Check Replit resource limits affecting performance
- Optimize Node.js event loop usage
- Implement proper garbage collection
- Monitor memory usage during conversion

7. USER EXPERIENCE ENHANCEMENTS:
- Add estimated time remaining display
- Show conversion speed (MB/s or pages/minute)
- Allow users to cancel slow conversions
- Provide progress details ("Processing page 5 of 20")

SPECIFIC TOOLS TO OPTIMIZE:
- PDF rotation (should be nearly instant)
- Image format conversion (should be 10-30 seconds)
- PDF compression (optimize algorithms)
- Document conversion (Word/Excel to PDF)

TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
1. Test with various file sizes (100KB, 1MB, 5MB, 10MB)
2. Measure actual conversion times vs. target benchmarks
3. Monitor server resource usage during conversion
4. Test multiple concurrent conversions

Please optimize the backend conversion process to achieve fast, efficient file processing that completes within reasonable timeframes and provides accurate progress feedback to users.
