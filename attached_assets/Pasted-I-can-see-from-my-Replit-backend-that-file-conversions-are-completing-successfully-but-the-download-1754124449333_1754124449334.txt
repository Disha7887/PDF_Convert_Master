I can see from my Replit backend that file conversions are completing successfully, but the download button is not appearing and users cannot download their converted files. This is a critical issue that needs immediate fixing.

CURRENT ISSUE ANALYSIS:
- Backend shows successful conversion: {"success":true,"message":"File download started","filename":"compressed-3-TinMan-by-Starfall_converted.pdf"}
- Frontend shows "Batch Conversion Finished" with success status
- Download button is completely missing from the UI
- No way for users to access their converted files

IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED:

1. FRONTEND DOWNLOAD BUTTON ISSUE:
- Download button not rendering after successful conversion
- Need to check ConversionWorkflow.tsx component state management
- Verify download button visibility conditions
- Fix React state updates causing UI rendering issues

2. BACKEND DOWNLOAD ENDPOINT PROBLEM:
- /api/download/:fileId returning JSON instead of actual file stream
- Need to implement proper file serving with correct headers
- Fix Content-Type and Content-Disposition headers for downloads
- Ensure file streaming instead of JSON response

3. FILE DOWNLOAD IMPLEMENTATION:
Current broken flow:
- Conversion completes ✅
- Backend creates file ✅  
- Download button missing ❌
- File download fails ❌

Required working flow:
- Conversion completes ✅
- Download button appears ✅
- Click triggers actual file download ✅
- File downloads with correct name ✅

SPECIFIC CODE FIXES NEEDED:

FRONTEND (ConversionWorkflow.tsx):
- Fix download button rendering logic
- Ensure proper state management for completed files
- Add download click handler that actually downloads files
- Fix React warnings about setState during render

BACKEND (server endpoint):
- Fix /api/download/:fileId to serve actual files not JSON
- Add proper file streaming with res.download()
- Set correct Content-Disposition headers
- Implement file cleanup after download

TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
1. Verify download button appears after conversion
2. Test actual file download (not JSON response)
3. Check downloaded file opens correctly
4. Verify proper filename is preserved
5. Test multiple file downloads

IMMEDIATE PRIORITY:
1. Make download button visible after successful conversion
2. Fix download endpoint to serve actual files
3. Test end-to-end conversion and download process
4. Ensure no React warnings or errors

Please fix both the missing download button UI issue and the backend file serving problem so users can successfully download their converted files.
