I need to redesign my PDF conversion tool's file upload page to make it clean, simple, and user-friendly. The current design is too complicated and overwhelming for users.

CURRENT ISSUES TO FIX:
- Upload page is too cluttered and complicated
- Too many elements and text causing confusion
- Design is not user-friendly or intuitive
- Page feels overwhelming with too much information
- Need a cleaner, more minimalist approach

REQUIRED SIMPLE DESIGN:

CLEAN LAYOUT STRUCTURE:
- Remove unnecessary text and elements
- Use plenty of white space for breathing room
- Keep only essential information visible
- Simple, centered layout design
- Minimal distractions from the main conversion task

SIMPLIFIED UPLOAD AREA:
- Large, prominent drag-drop zone (center focus)
- Simple icon (upload arrow or document icon)
- Clear, short text: "Drop files here or click to browse"
- Single "Browse Files" button (not multiple options)
- Remove complex file format lists and technical details

STREAMLINED FILE MANAGEMENT:
- Show selected files in a clean, simple list
- File name + size only (remove unnecessary details)
- Simple "X" remove button for each file
- Clean "Convert" button that's easy to find
- Remove complicated progress bars until needed

MINIMAL INFORMATION DISPLAY:
- Show only essential file requirements (e.g., "PDF files only")
- Remove lengthy descriptions and feature lists
- Hide technical specifications unless needed
- Use simple, clear language
- Remove redundant security/privacy statements

CLEAN VISUAL DESIGN:
- Use consistent spacing and typography
- Reduce color complexity (stick to 2-3 main colors)
- Remove unnecessary borders and shadows
- Clean, modern icons
- Simple button designs

USER-FRIENDLY IMPROVEMENTS:
- Clear visual hierarchy (most important elements first)
- Intuitive user flow (upload → convert → download)
- Remove confusion by hiding advanced options
- One clear call-to-action per screen
- Responsive design that works on all devices

EXAMPLES OF WHAT TO REMOVE:
- Long feature descriptions
- Multiple file format explanations
- Complex technical details
- Redundant buttons and options
- Unnecessary footer information on upload page

Please redesign the upload page to be as simple as popular tools like WeTransfer or Dropbox - clean, minimal, and focused only on the core task of file conversion.
