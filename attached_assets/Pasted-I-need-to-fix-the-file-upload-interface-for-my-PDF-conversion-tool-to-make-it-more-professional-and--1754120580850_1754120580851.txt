I need to fix the file upload interface for my PDF conversion tool to make it more professional and support multiple file uploads simultaneously.

CURRENT ISSUES TO FIX:
- File selection popup UI looks unprofessional and basic
- Only single file upload is supported, need multiple file selection
- Upload interface needs modern, sleek design
- Missing drag-and-drop visual feedback
- No file preview or management before conversion

REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS:

MULTIPLE FILE UPLOAD FUNCTIONALITY:
- Enable selecting multiple PDF files at once (Ctrl+Click or Shift+Click)
- Support drag-and-drop of multiple files simultaneously
- Show "Select Multiple Files" or "Choose Files" instead of "Select PDF File"
- Display file count like "5 files selected" instead of "1 file(s) selected"

PROFESSIONAL FILE UPLOAD UI:
- Replace basic file input with custom styled upload area
- Add modern file selection modal/popup design
- Include file type icons and file size display
- Add individual file remove/delete options before conversion
- Show file validation status (✓ Valid PDF or ❌ Invalid format)

FILE MANAGEMENT INTERFACE:
- Display selected files in a clean list/grid format
- Show file names, sizes, and types for each selected file
- Add "Remove" button for individual files
- Include "Clear All" option to remove all selected files
- Add file reordering capability (drag to reorder)

ENHANCED DRAG-DROP AREA:
- Improve visual feedback when dragging files over the area
- Change border color/style during drag hover
- Add animated upload icon or progress indicators
- Include file format hints (e.g., "Supports: PDF files up to 10MB each")
- Show maximum file count limits if any

BATCH CONVERSION FEATURES:
- Single "Convert All Files" button for batch processing
- Individual progress bars for each file during conversion
- Batch download option (ZIP file with all converted files)
- Option to convert files individually or as a batch

MODERN UI STYLING:
- Use professional color scheme matching the dark theme
- Add smooth transitions and hover effects
- Include proper spacing and typography
- Add loading states and micro-interactions
- Ensure responsive design for all screen sizes

Please implement these improvements while maintaining the current dark theme aesthetic and ensuring the interface works seamlessly across all devices.
