My PDF to Word converter shows "Conversion Complete!" but the file status shows "Failed - Failed to check conversion status" instead of providing a working download button. Need to fix the status checking and download functionality.

CURRENT ISSUE ANALYSIS:
- Frontend shows "Conversion Complete!" with green checkmark
- File displays as "Failed" with red error icon
- Error message: "Failed to check conversion status"
- No download button appears despite "successful" conversion
- Backend processing may be working but status checking is broken

CRITICAL FIXES NEEDED:

1. STATUS CHECKING API FIX:
- Fix the conversion status endpoint that's failing
- Ensure proper job status updates from "processing" → "completed"
- Fix API response format for status checks
- Verify status polling logic in frontend

2. DOWNLOAD ENDPOINT RESTORATION:
Based on previous tabs showing /api/download/2 and /api/download/3 both failing:
- Fix the download endpoint to serve actual files instead of JSON errors
- Ensure files are properly saved after conversion
- Implement proper file streaming with correct headers
- Add file existence validation before serving

3. FRONTEND-BACKEND SYNC:
- Fix contradiction between "Conversion Complete!" message and "Failed" file status
- Ensure consistent status reporting across the application
- Fix job polling to properly detect completion vs failure
- Update UI state management for successful conversions

4. FILE CONVERSION VERIFICATION:
- Verify that PDF to Word conversion actually produces valid DOCX files
- Check if conversion libraries (mammoth, pdf-lib) are working correctly
- Ensure proper error handling distinguishes between conversion failure and status check failure
- Test with real file conversion, not dummy files

5. IMMEDIATE DEBUGGING STEPS:
- Check server logs during conversion and status checking
- Verify job completion updates database correctly
- Test status API endpoint directly (/api/job/status/:jobId)
- Ensure download URLs are generated and accessible

6. EXPECTED WORKING FLOW:
Current broken: Upload ✅ → Convert ✅ → Status check ❌ → Download ❌
Required working: Upload ✅ → Convert ✅ → Status check ✅ → Download ✅

Please fix the status checking mechanism and ensure that successfully converted files show proper status and provide working download functionality.
