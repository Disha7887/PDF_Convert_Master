# Switching to Your Main Repository

## Current Status
✅ Remote URL updated to: `https://github.com/Disha7887/PDF_Convert_Master.git`
✅ Fetched latest changes from your main repo
⚠️ Need to run final command to complete the switch

## Complete the Setup

Run this command to get all your latest files:

```bash
cd ~/pdf-convert-frontend
git reset --hard origin/main
```

## After Running the Command

Your `~/pdf-convert-frontend` will contain the latest version of your main repository with all your Builder.io edits and project files.

## Updated Workflow

Once complete, your workflow will be:

1. **Edit in Builder.io** → Publish (saves to PDF_Convert_Master repo)
2. **In Replit**:
   ```bash
   cd ~/pdf-convert-frontend
   git fetch origin main
   git reset --hard origin/main
   ```
3. **Your changes appear** in your project

This connects you to your main repository instead of the separate frontend-only repo we were using before.
