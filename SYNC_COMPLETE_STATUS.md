- ✅ Latest Builder.io changes synced (active button styles)
- ✅ Clean working directory ready for more edits
- ✅ Backend preserved in main workspace (~workspace) with all conversion tools

### Daily Workflow:
1. **Visual Edit in Builder.io** → Publish changes
2. **Sync to Replit**:
   ```bash
   cd ~/pdf-convert-frontend
   git fetch origin main
   git reset --hard origin/main
   ```
3. **Your changes appear** in your project files

## Two-Project Architecture

### Frontend Project (`~/pdf-convert-frontend`):
- Connected to Builder.io for visual editing
- Synced with pdf-convert-frontend repository
- Independent React/Vite project for safe visual editing

### Backend Project (`~/workspace`):
- All conversion tools and authentication working
- Database and API endpoints functional
- Independent from visual editing changes

Your Builder.io integration is ready for visual editing!
