# Dodo Payments (web app billing)

Replaces the old no-payment plan switch. Plans: free $0 / pro $9 / business $29.

## Source of truth
Dodo subscription state is the source of truth for `users.plan`; the webhook
mirrors it. The DB tracks `dodoCustomerId` + `dodoSubscriptionId` on users
(nullable text cols, pushed to Supabase via `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push`).

## Flow
- Upgrade (free→paid): `POST /api/billing/checkout` → hosted Dodo checkout redirect.
- Switch/cancel (existing subscriber): Dodo **customer portal** only (`/api/billing/portal`).
- `/api/account/plan` is restricted to free-only and rejects a free switch while
  `dodoSubscriptionId` is set — this is what closes the monetization hole.
- `/api/billing/checkout` refuses a second checkout when a sub already exists.

## Webhook (`/api/billing/dodo/webhook`)
- No auth; authenticity = Standard-Webhooks HMAC verified against
  `DODO_PAYMENTS_WEBHOOK_KEY` over the RAW body (captured in app.ts express.json `verify`).
- Only `subscription.*` events are acted on (one-time/credit packs are mobile/RevenueCat).
- **Plan tier = product id, not metadata.** `getPlanForProductId(product_id)` is
  authoritative; `metadata.planId` is only a fallback (it goes stale after a
  portal plan switch).
- **Gate downgrades by subscription_id match.** On cancelled/expired/failed, only
  downgrade to free if the event's `subscription_id` equals the user's tracked
  `dodoSubscriptionId` — otherwise a delayed/out-of-order cancel for a replaced
  sub would wrongly revoke paid access.
- **Grant on subscription STATUS, never event type.** Plan changes are driven by
  the payload's top-level `sub.status` (`pending|active|on_hold|cancelled|failed|
  expired`), NOT by `event.type`. Only `active` grants/keeps a paid plan;
  cancelled/expired/failed downgrade (with the trackedSub guard above);
  pending/on_hold/unknown do nothing. **Why:** Dodo fires `subscription.active`/
  `subscription.updated` during creation and payment retries even when the first
  charge has NOT settled — keying on event type handed paid access to users whose
  payment FAILED (real reported billing bug). Cancel-at-period-end stays correct:
  access is retained while status remains `active`.
**Why (overall):** these guards were caught in architect review / production bug
reports; without them stale or unsettled events corrupt plan state.

## Config (env vars, not secret except keys)
- Secrets: `DODO_PAYMENTS_API_KEY`, `DODO_PAYMENTS_WEBHOOK_KEY`.
- Env: `DODO_PRODUCT_PRO`, `DODO_PRODUCT_BUSINESS`, `DODO_PAYMENTS_ENVIRONMENT`
  (`test_mode`|`live_mode`). `isBillingConfigured()` = api key + ≥1 product id;
  `/api/billing/config` exposes `enabled` to the web UI.
- User must create the webhook in the Dodo dashboard → subscription events →
  endpoint `https://pdfgenius.app/api/billing/dodo/webhook`.

## Buy Credits (web pay-what-you-want, one-time)
Web users can buy a custom $ of credits (was mobile-only before). Rate
`CREDITS_PER_USD=100` (1 credit = 1¢), `MIN_CREDITS_USD=1`, `MAX_CREDITS_USD=500`
— all in `dodo.ts`.
- Product: a single **pay_what_you_want one-time** Dodo product; id in env
  `DODO_PRODUCT_CREDITS`. Checkout passes the chosen `amount` (cents) on the cart
  line so the customer can't change it, plus metadata `{userId,kind:"credits",credits,amountCents}`.
- Endpoint: `POST /api/billing/credits-checkout` (authenticated, validates min/max),
  returnUrl `?checkout=credits-success` → web polls balance on return.
- **Credits UI lives on its OWN page** `/dashboard/buy-credits` (component
  `CreditPurchaseCard`), separate from Manage Plans. The credits-checkout
  return/cancel URLs MUST point at wherever that card is mounted, and only ONE
  component may handle `?checkout=credits-success` (the card owns it) — Manage
  Plans only handles plan `success`/`cancelled`. **Why:** two mounted handlers =
  double toast/double poll; a mismatched returnUrl lands the user on a page with
  no handler so the balance never refreshes.
- **Grant ONLY in the `payment.succeeded` webhook, idempotent on `payment_id`**
  (`storage.grantCreditsForPurchase`, unique `credit_grants.purchase_id`).
- **Fulfillment trust boundary (architect-required):** never grant on metadata
  alone. Gate on the settled `product_cart` actually containing
  `DODO_PRODUCT_CREDITS`, and for USD recompute credits from the **pre-tax** settled
  amount (`total_amount - tax`), not `metadata.credits` (metadata is only a
  cross-check / non-USD fallback). **Why:** metadata is attacker-influenced;
  discounts/coupons/tax can make it diverge from money actually collected.
- **Dashboard webhook MUST also subscribe to `payment.succeeded`** (it was
  subscription.* only) or credits never grant in test/live.

## SDK product creation shape (recurring)
`client.products.create({ name, tax_category:"saas", price:{ type:"recurring_price",
price: dollars*100, currency:"USD", payment_frequency_interval:"Month",
subscription_period_interval:"Month", ... } })`. Going live = recreate products in
live_mode and swap the product-id env vars + `DODO_PAYMENTS_ENVIRONMENT=live_mode`.
